# JqueryValidationDemo
This project demonstrates a simple and secure login form using jQuery Validation Plugin and PHP. It includes client-side form validation with Bootstrap for styling and server-side processing with PHP and ADOdb for secure password handling. The backend utilizes PHPâ€™s password_hash and password_verify functions for encrypted password management.
